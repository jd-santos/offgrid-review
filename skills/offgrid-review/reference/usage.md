# Offgrid Review Usage

The `offgrid-review` Python CLI is the deterministic compiler underneath the
agent workflow. It combines source data and a review specification into one
offline HTML file with embedded styles, behavior, and review content. The
package uses only the Python standard library at runtime.

## Try the checked-in examples

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/jd-santos/offgrid-review.git
cd offgrid-review

uvx --from . offgrid-review \
  --data skills/offgrid-review/examples/review-data.json \
  --spec skills/offgrid-review/examples/review-spec.json \
  --out review.html

uvx --from . offgrid-review \
  --data skills/offgrid-review/examples/review-plan-data.json \
  --spec skills/offgrid-review/examples/review-plan-spec.json \
  --out review-plan.html
```

Open either HTML file, record decisions, then download or copy the exported
JSON. Send that file to the separate apply pass.

The first example reviews community-workshop launch tasks and reconciles two
records side by side. The second reviews a complete event plan with tables,
flows, a timeline, a dependency graph, a chart, and a final decision. Both use
the same persistence, validation, summary, and export model.

## Platform support

The CLI requires Python 3.10 or later. It is developed and manually tested on
macOS. CI exercises Ubuntu, but broader Linux compatibility and WSL have not
been manually verified. Native Windows is unsupported.

## Workflow

1. A read-only script snapshots deterministic source data as JSON.
2. An agent writes the review spec for the current question.
3. `offgrid-review` creates the static console.
4. A human selects actions and adds notes.
5. The console exports decision JSON.
6. The apply pass re-fetches live state before making approved changes.

See [artifact-contract.md](artifact-contract.md) for schemas and
[apply-pass.md](apply-pass.md) for the safety boundary.

## Minimal spec

Actions are multi-select by default:

```json
{
  "title": "My Review",
  "review_id": "my-review",
  "subtitle": "Review proposed changes. Nothing is applied from this page.",
  "global_actions": [
    {
      "id": "defer",
      "label": "Defer for later",
      "exclusive": true
    }
  ],
  "queues": [
    {
      "id": "main",
      "title": "Main queue",
      "description": "Select every compatible follow-up.",
      "source": "main_items",
      "question": "Which actions should be taken?",
      "selection_mode": "multiple",
      "detail_keys": ["status", "priority", "description"],
      "primary_keys": ["status", "priority"],
      "actions": [
        {
          "id": "accept",
          "label": "Accept the proposal",
          "description": "Carry the proposed values into the apply pass."
        },
        {
          "id": "request_changes",
          "label": "Request changes",
          "requires_note": true,
          "conflicts_with": ["accept"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The data JSON needs a matching source key:

```json
{
  "date": "2026-08-01",
  "main_items": [
    {
      "id": "item-a",
      "title": "Example item",
      "status": "Ready",
      "priority": "p1"
    }
  ]
}
```

Save those objects as `review-spec.json` and `review-data.json`, then generate
the console from the current GitHub release candidate:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/jd-santos/offgrid-review.git offgrid-review \
  --data review-data.json \
  --spec review-spec.json \
  --out review.html
```

The CLI can also write a generic starter specification:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/jd-santos/offgrid-review.git offgrid-review \
  --write-default-spec \
  --spec starter-spec.json
```

The starter spec expects data under `example_items`. The command refuses to
replace an existing specification unless you pass `--force`.

After the first PyPI release, replace the Git-source prefix with
`uvx offgrid-review`. UVX selects the latest available version on its first
invocation and then reuses its cached environment. Run
`uvx --refresh-package offgrid-review offgrid-review --version` when you want
it to check for a newer package. Exact pins such as `offgrid-review@0.1.0` are
reserved for reproducibility and release verification.

The CLI validates both inputs before writing HTML. Queue items need stable IDs,
action and block IDs must be unique in their scopes, conflict references must
resolve, and queue sources must be arrays. Expected failures return exit code 2
with JSON-path errors instead of a traceback. Each input file has a 25 MB limit.

## Framing large reviews

Queues are the reviewer-facing categories inside a decision batch. Group items
that share context, a question, and an action set. Do not use queues as arbitrary
pagination.

For an evaluation with roughly 100 decisions:

1. Start with 5–10 categories based on decision type, source, risk, area of
   responsibility, or the context needed to answer well.
2. Put high-value and high-risk queues first. Keep lower-priority cleanup from
   obscuring decisions that deserve more attention.
3. Write one concrete question and description per queue. If half the items need
   a different question, split the queue.
4. Keep enough evidence visible to decide without opening raw source data for
   every item.
5. Offer likely actions, but do not force a poor fit. A decision note is a valid
   complete response when the proposed actions miss the reviewer’s intent.

Prefer a few meaningful queues over dozens of tiny ones. Prefer separate review
artifacts when categories have unrelated goals, audiences, or apply boundaries.

## Selection behavior

Use `selection_mode: "multiple"` unless the domain permits exactly one answer.
The console renders native checkboxes and lets compatible actions coexist.

Use `selection_mode: "single"` for a truly exclusive queue. The console renders
native radio controls.

An action can also set `exclusive: true`. Selecting it clears other actions on
the same item. Global fallback actions are exclusive by default.

Use `conflicts_with` to declare invalid combinations without silently choosing
for the reviewer:

```json
{
  "id": "approve",
  "label": "Approve",
  "conflicts_with": ["request_changes"]
}
```

Conflicts remain visible and make the export invalid until corrected.

## Action metadata

Use `description` to explain an action's effect. `risk` and `reversible` expose
operational consequences before selection. `requires_note` collects rationale,
while `exclusive` and `conflicts_with` define which choices may coexist. The
[artifact contract](artifact-contract.md) defines each field.

High-risk and irreversible actions use a muted plum risk treatment. Risk never
uses the blush selection color. Red remains reserved for validation errors and
urgent danger.

## Granular notes

Every decision includes a note beside its actions. Each action also includes a
progressively revealed note field. Queue-item plan sections and top-level
document blocks receive their own comment controls when they have stable IDs.

A selected action or any substantive note attached to a decision marks that
decision complete. If no action is selected, the response exports in
`annotations` rather than `decisions`. It tells the agent that the reviewer has
answered, but it does not authorize the apply pass to mutate the source system.

The exported entry contains:

```json
{
  "note": "legacy item-level alias",
  "notes": {
    "item": "general context",
    "actions": { "request_changes": "specific rationale" },
    "sections": { "flow": "section feedback" }
  }
}
```

Feedback with no selected action is exported in the top-level `annotations`
array. It is not approval to mutate the item or document.

## Queue-item plan sections

A dictionary item can include structured sections:

```json
{
  "id": "plan-a",
  "title": "Draft workflow",
  "status": "Draft",
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": "goal",
      "title": "Goal",
      "body": "Describe the intended outcome."
    },
    {
      "id": "checks",
      "title": "Checks",
      "kind": "table",
      "columns": ["State", "Response"],
      "rows": [["Conflict", "Resolve before export"]]
    },
    {
      "id": "flow",
      "title": "Review flow",
      "kind": "diagram",
      "nodes": [
        { "id": "inspect", "title": "Inspect" },
        { "id": "decide", "title": "Decide" }
      ],
      "edges": [
        { "from": "inspect", "to": "decide" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Section prose is treated as plain text. Tables and diagram structures are
escaped and rendered without third-party JavaScript.

## Planning-document review

Use top-level semantic `blocks` when the whole artifact should read like a
document instead of a queue card:

```json
{
  "title": "Release Proposal",
  "subtitle": "Review the plan and return a direction decision.",
  "document_id": "release_plan",
  "document_title": "Planning proposal",
  "document_description": "Review the proposal in order.",
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "overview",
      "id": "overview",
      "source": "plan.overview"
    },
    {
      "type": "flow",
      "id": "delivery_flow",
      "source": "plan.flow"
    },
    {
      "type": "decision",
      "id": "direction",
      "title": "Direction decision",
      "question": "What should happen with this proposal?",
      "actions": [
        { "id": "approve", "label": "Approve the direction" },
        {
          "id": "revise",
          "label": "Request revisions",
          "requires_note": true,
          "conflicts_with": ["approve"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "queues": []
}
```

Supported block types are `overview`, `prose`, `decision`, `table`, `flow`,
`timeline`, `dependency_graph`, `chart`, and `svg`. A block can define content
inline or use a dot-separated `source` path into the data JSON. Explicit spec
fields override source fields.

Choose the block that matches the review question. Use flow for ordered stages,
timeline for dated or sequenced events, dependency graph for relationships, and
chart only for quantitative comparisons. Tables remain the best default for
precise side-by-side values.

### Visual alternatives

Generated flows include ordered steps and connection statements. Dependency
graphs include node descriptions and dependency statements. Charts include a
source-value table. These alternatives stay in visible disclosures immediately
below each visual.

### Custom SVG

Use `svg` only when the structured visual types cannot express the content. A
custom SVG block requires:

- `svg` containing a positive `viewBox`, `title`, and `desc`.
- `fallback` as text or a list of text statements.
- Markup limited to the generator's element, attribute, color, transform, size,
  and complexity allowlists.

The generator parses and serializes accepted SVG. It rejects scripts, handlers,
links, images, animation, filters, masks, patterns, embedded HTML, styles,
external references, unknown namespaces, and oversized input. A rejected
visual shows an error and preserves the required fallback. Original custom SVG
source is not copied into annotation snapshots.

See `examples/review-plan-spec.json` and `examples/review-plan-data.json` for a
complete document demo.

## Review navigation

The console includes:

- Search over titles, evidence, and action labels.
- Queue and completion filters.
- **Needs a decision** navigation with short **Previous** and **Next** controls.
- Overall completion followed by quiet per-queue completion fractions.
- Queue navigation that marks the current queue.
- **On this page** links for semantic documents, with current-section state.
- A floating list control at 1120 pixels and below that opens a nonmodal
  contents drawer above the mobile action tray.
- Document-only navigation that omits queue search and filters.
- `Alt+/` to focus search.
- `Alt+J` and `Alt+K` to move between decisions that still need an answer.
- A mobile action tray that follows the current decision.
- A nonmodal review summary.

Native controls, a skip link, visible focus, semantic field grouping, live
status messages, 24 CSS-pixel targets, 200 percent text reflow, and
reduced-motion support are built in. Generated consoles target WCAG 2.2 AA;
manual assistive-technology checks remain part of release validation.

## Themes

The console follows the system theme by default. **File details** offers
explicit System, Light, and Dark choices. The override uses browser storage when
available. Both themes keep blush for selection and annotation, muted plum for
risk, and red for validation errors or urgent danger.

## Summary and export

Each export identifies the schema version, generator version, review ID, source
data fingerprint, specification fingerprint, and combined artifact
fingerprint. The apply pass should reject an unsupported schema and use the
fingerprints when deciding whether source data is stale.

The summary reports:

- Complete decisions and decisions that still need an answer.
- Counts by selected action.
- High-risk and irreversible actions.
- Conflicts.
- Missing required rationale.
- Notes added across decisions and document blocks.

Export is gated when any warning remains. The reviewer can still export from
the summary, but the JSON preserves `complete`, `valid`, and `warnings` so the
apply pass cannot mistake a partial or invalid review for a clean one.

`actions` is the canonical selected-action array. When there is exactly one
selection, `action` and `label` are also populated for older apply scripts.

## Complete field reference

The [artifact contract](artifact-contract.md) is the authoritative reference for
all data, specification, block, action, storage, and export fields. This guide
focuses on choosing those fields and using the generated console.

## File-viewer constraints

The generated HTML and decision JSON contain complete source snapshots,
including values hidden behind disclosures. Anyone who receives either file can
inspect those values. Do not include secrets or unrelated private data.

Some Telegram, iOS, and local-file viewers block `localStorage` or clipboard
access. The console catches those failures, keeps the current session usable,
and tells the reviewer to download before closing. Copy falls back to an inline
JSON preview.

The generated file never calls an API or applies a decision. If a workflow
needs mutation, implement it in the verified apply pass.
